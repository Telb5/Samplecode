-When u put dryRun = true;  this won't run your test cases but only write the features for you.
so you have to change it to false.

-"or" is used in case u want to run more than one test,
 example : tags="@testcase1 or @testcase2")




#Notes :

    #HOOKS: For defining pre and Post steps in any Cucumber framework
    #     : This is always created inside the StepDefinitions folder
    #     : Hooks will take care of pre and post conditions irrespective
    #     : of what goes in between the test steps


// we cannot inherit hooks





  #BACKGROUND: it is the clubbing of common steps in different scenarios of a feature file till the flow is broken
  #1: Hard code
  #2: Config file
  #------------------Cucumber itself provides multiple options through which we can feed data from feature file into stepdefintion
  #3: Regular Expressions :
       # put the data in double quotes [""]
  #4: Scenario Outline :
       # Provides you an alternative to Data driven testing
       # Also supports parametrization






    #===================================PARAMETERIZATION================================
  # Executing the same test case with multiple data





  #=============================ScenarioOutline======================================#
  #If you want to use parameterization
  #If you wish to implement data driven testing
    # Scenario Outline is always used along with the keyword 'Examples'






   -target folder is mostly used for storing the test case execution reports generated using Cucumber


   -Page Object Model : an object repository [ it stores or holds all the webElements specific to a particular page]

   -Every 'Page Object' should inherit the 'CommonMEthods class'


   -Scenario outline notes :
   with scenario outline, if we have 3 different data 'username' + 'password', JAVA will open browser, enter credentials on, close
   browser, then iterate 3 times.


   -Data Table notes :
   with Data Tables it will only run test 1 times with 3 different credentials for example and then close and this is not because
   of Data Table structure but because of JAVA and the code written for it.

   - option + command + L     = Align the lines of code
